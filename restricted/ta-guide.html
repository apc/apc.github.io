</header>


<h2 id="expectations">Expectations</h2>
<p>I expect you will all come to all the lectures. One reason for this is that you will be keeping track of your students’ attendance and participation during lecture. If you can’t make it to lecture for some reason, please let me know in advance so we can make alternate arrangements.</p>
<p>I would appreciate it if some of you sit in the back, so you can keep an eye on disruptive students. I hope to enforce a no-electronics policy in lecture, and having some people sit in the back goes some way towards achieving that goal.</p>
<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
<p>You will be in charge of grading all the assignments. This involves grading three papers per student (which will be graded anonymously), in addition to a final exam. You will also be in charge of determining their section grade (more on this <a href="#discussionsections">below</a>).</p>
<p>As a general rule, you should aim to have the papers graded within a week of their due date. I understand that this may not always be feasible. Please get in touch with me if you think you will not be able to finish the grading in time.</p>
<p>It is important to ensure a reasonable amount of consistency of standards among TAs. To that effect, after you have graded the <em>first</em> batch of papers, I will ask that you send me:</p>
<ul>
<li>one of the papers that received the highest grade you gave,</li>
<li>one of the papers that received the lowest grade you gave,</li>
<li>one of the papers that received a grade closest to the average grade you gave.</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure to let me know what grade you gave to each of the papers.</p>
<p>At the end of the semester, we may curve the final grades if necessary.</p>
<h2 id="discussion-sections">Discussion sections</h2>
<p>A major component of the grade for this course will be based on what they do during discussion section. The goal is to have them do some form of writing for every discussion section. The particular activity should depend on the time of the semester you are in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before the first paper is due, the goal is to get them to explain an argument in their own words.</li>
<li>After the first paper is due and before the second paper is due, the goal is to get them to raise objections to an argument.</li>
<li>After the second paper is due, the goal is to have them respond to objections to an argument.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are different ways of helping them acquire these skills. Here are a few suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Give them 10 minutes to write down an explanation of an argument of your choice from the week’s readings.</li>
<li>Have them write an explanation of an argument of your choice and bring it with them to section.</li>
<li>Reconstruct an argument from the week’s readings. Have them come up with three objections to that arguments and write them down.</li>
<li>Have them study a passage from the week’s readings where an objection to an argument is discussed. Split them into small groups and have them figure out what premise or transition is being challenged. Also: have them respond to that objection and write that down.</li>
<li>Brainstorm possible objections to an argument. Pick a couple of the better ones. Discuss them and have them write out one of them in their own words.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the first two weeks, we should get together to discuss possible activities for each section. After that, you might want to coordinate among yourselves, but it is OK if you prefer not to.</p>
<h2 id="feedback-on-in-class-exercises">Feedback on in-class exercises</h2>
<p>They should get feedback on these assignments. Some of it should come from you: you should make sure to give feedback to each student at least once for each of the three skills. But they could also get feedback from their peers. Here are some suggestions on how to accomplish this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have them pair up and give each other feedback.</li>
<li>Pick up a few of their assignments at random at the end of section and give them feedback.</li>
<li>Select a few of the assignments and read them to the entire class: the whole class can discuss ways of making it better. (It is probably best if you do not reveal the identities of the authors.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal is to find a balance between minimizing the amount of additional work for you outside of discussion sections, and maximizing the amount number of opportunities they have to practice each of the skills they will need in order to write a paper.</p>
<p>They should collect their written assignments and hand them all to you at the end of each unit.</p>
<h2 id="extensions">Extensions</h2>
<p>The course policy on extensions is clear. You should feel free to contact me if you do not know whether a particular student’s request for an extension is legitimate. By default, illnesses and other medical or family emergencies are good grounds for granting an exception. Whether other circumstances are enough to warrant an extension will depend on the details: as a general rule, the more in advance a student contacts you about an extension, the more generous you should feel free to be.</p>
<h2 id="students-with-disabilities">Students with disabilities</h2>
<p>If a student is registered with disability services, I will be notified via email of the accommodations they require. I will forward any such request to all of you. I expect you will keep track of which of the students in your section needs special accommodations. At some point in the first few weeks we should meet to discuss each of these cases.</p>
<h2 id="dealing-with-plagiarism">Dealing with plagiarism</h2>
<p>Please make sure to come to me <em>as soon as possible</em> if you have any suspicion of plagiarism. For the three papers, we will be using <a href="http://www.turnitin.com">Turnitin</a>, a service you may already be familiar with. This is a service that compares the student’s assignment against a rather large database, including most of the things you can find online. Sometimes, similarities can be easily explained. If you can’t explain why an assignment is similar to other online sources, get in touch with me as soon as possible.</p>
