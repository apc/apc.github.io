			<h3>Structuring logical space</h3>
			<p class="abs">I develop a <i>non-representationalist</i> account of mathematical thought, on which the point of mathematical theorizing is to provide us with the conceptual capacity to structure and articulate information about the physical world in an epistemically useful way. On my view, accepting a mathematical theory is not a matter of having a belief about some subject matter; it is rather a matter of <i>structuring logical space</i>, in a sense to be made precise. This provides an elegant account of the cognitive utility of mathematics. Further, it makes explicit how the brand of non-representationalism (or non-factualism) I develop is compatible with there being substantive rationality constraints on our mathematical theorizing.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Negation, expressivism, and intentionality</h3>
			<p class="abs">Mark Schroeder thinks that expressivists have a problem with negation. I disagree. Or at least, I disagree that <i>expressivists</i> have a problem with negation. For if there is a problem with negation, it is a problem we all have. Or at least, a problem <i>most</i> of us have&#8212;those of us, expressivists and descriptivists alike, who accept some very plausible claims about the nature of intentionality. </p>
			<br>
			<h3>Good questions</h3>
			<p class="abs">We care about the truth: we want to believe what is true, and avoid believing what is false. But not all truths are created equal. There is something more valuable, <i>epistemically</i>, about our botanical beliefs than about those we get out of counting blades of grass. In this paper, I aim to vindicate this intuition: that some lines of inquiry are better, epistemically, than others. I show how, by assigning epistemic value to different bodies of belief, we can evaluate a given line of inquiry on the basis of the value of the body of belief that this line of inquiry is expected to yield. I outline a framework for understanding this notion of epistemic value, by looking at the extent to which a given body of beliefs is explanatorily closed, and rely on the notion of <i>counterfactual resilience</i> as a tractable guide to explanatory closure.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>A framework for conceptual evaluation</h3>
			<p class="abs">This is a technical companion to &lsquo;Good questions&rsquo;. I provide a way of extending the notion of a <em>scoring rule</em> to allow for the evaluations of credence functions defined over different algebras of propositions. I show that, in this generalized context, there are no &lsquo;universal&rsquo; scoring rules&#8212;that every scoring rule will sometimes recommend adopting a different credence function from one&rsquo;s own. I then examine alternative constraints on scoring rules, with an eye to giving a formal model of how the adoption of new conceptual resources could be epistemically rational.</p>

			<h3>Expressivism, relativism, and the problem of communication <span style="font-weight:normal">(with <a href="">Paolo Santorio</a>)</span></h3> 
			<p class="abs">Expressivism and relativism about a certain discourse (e.g. moral discourse) are often seen as competing positions. Against this, we argue that relativism and expressivism are complementary. More precisely, we claim that any form of expressivism about a given discourse must help itself to a relativistic semantics. In essence, the argument is that an account of communication needs to rely on a notion of truth, and the particular notion of truth the expressivist needs is just the one used by the relativist.</p>

			<h3>Toward a dissolution of the proviso problem<!-- <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote" style="padding-left:1px;font-weight:normal;color:#d53c2e">*</a></sup> --></h3>
			<p class="abs">The received view on the relationship between presupposition and accommodation is that the <i>identity hypothesis</i>&#8212;according to which what is accommodated after an utterance of a sentence just is what the sentence presupposes&#8212;cannot be right. The case against the identity hypothesis is based on data commonly taken to decisively refute the view. The much discussed <i>proviso problem</i> is essentially that of providing an alternative to the identity hypothesis that can account for the putative counterexamples. Against the received view, I argue that the identity hypothesis is in fact compatible with the relevant data. I do this by looking at the ways in which the context set of a conversation affects the process of accommodation. This constitutes the first steps towards a dissolution of the proviso problem. (A version of this paper appeared in <i>MIT Working Papers in Linguistics</i>, <a href="http://mitwpl.mit.edu/catalog/mwpl60/">vol. 60</a> (2009), edited by <a href="http://paulegre.free.fr/">Paul Égré</a> and <a href="http://web.mac.com/giorgiomagri/iWeb/Site/Home.html">Giorgio Magri</a>)</p>
